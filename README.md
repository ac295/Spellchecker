# Spellchecker
Authors: Allan Chung

**About:**


This application is built using JavaFX and features a user-friendly interface that includes a text box. Users have the following options:

1. Open an existing file within the application.
2. Save the contents of the text box as a .txt file.
3. Exit the application.
4. Utilize a Spellcheck feature, which checks words against a comprehensive dictionary containing over 30,000 entries.

The spellchecking functionality is implemented via a hash map for efficient word lookups. When an incorrect word is entered, the application provides suggestions for corrections. For instance, if the user types the misspelled word "gree," the application will suggest alternatives such as "green," "gee," "greed," "greet," "agree," and "grebe."
